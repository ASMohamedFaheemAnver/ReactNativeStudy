* IOS steps.
-> Open workspace in xcode.
-> Create multiple targets from existing one.
-> Change target names and plist names.
-> Go to "Build settings" for each target and confirm target is pointing to expected plist path.
-> Go to Product -> Schema -> Manage schema -> Delete copies and create new one with target and put proper name.
-> Install react-native-config -> Pod install -> Will face errors -> Add all the targets to inherit dependencies.
# Seems like this not working perfectly
-> Go to Product -> Schema -> Edit schema -> Build -> Pre actions -> Add new run script action and add : cp "${PROJECT_DIR}/../.env.dev" "${PROJECT_DIR}/../.env" and make sure to select provide build settings from with correct target.
# Fix: Try this https://github.com/lugg/react-native-config/issues/591 if have time
-> "deleteDerivedData": "rm -rf ${HOME}/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*" Works but takes too long time to build.
-> Alternative and seems faster: "preBuild": "rm -f node_modules/react-native-config/ios/ReactNativeConfig/GeneratedDotEnv.m node_modules/react-native-config/android/build/generated/source/buildConfig/debug/com/lugg/RNCConfig/BuildConfig.java node_modules/react-native-config/android/build/generated/source/buildConfig/release/com/lugg/RNCConfig/BuildConfig.java"
